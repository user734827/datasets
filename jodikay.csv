You’re here because you want to build a better life for yourself and a successful business without feeling like you have to sacrifice the quality of your life to get it.



Burnout happens when we take on too much in too little time. As entrepreneurs, we wear several hats. We start out as the strategist, the marketer, the social media manager, the accountant, the person who delivers the product/service and so much more. It's no wonder entrepreneurship can feel exhausting at times! We get stuck with this idea that we have to work hard for what we want and as ambitious entrepreneurs, we want it all so we feel like we have to do it all. But you don't have to. 

Remove this idea of having to work hard and hustle for everything you want in life and affirm that building a business can feel easy.

Hard work gets you NOWHERE if you aren't aligned.

Inside this mini e-course, you'll learn how to:

-Create better boundaries for yourself and your business-Set a morning routine that helps you to feel grounded and invigorated every day-My powerful mindset and manifestation hack-My favorite way of generating money in my business without me working in or on it-How to listen to your business when it tells you it's time to hire your first, or new team member-How to reverse that burnt out I just can't do anything right now feeling real quick Ease, flow, and alignment is the new hustle.

Think again. Over half of those viral, popular images you're seeing on Instagram are leading back to a website or a blog where the owner is selling a product or service. Learn how I get paid to travel, land exclusive invites, grow my brand with big names like Covergirl, Essence Magazine, Warby Parker and more.

It's no secret that online influencers are the new preferred way of marketing. In this 5 module e-course learn the exact steps to positioning yourself as an online influencer to lead up to the entrepreneur that you were meant to be.



I’ll show you the exact steps I used to turn my popular fashion blog from passion project to pure profit. This blog really helped me skyrocket myself as an influencer in the blogging world. As a lifestyle blogger of over 10 years, I’m sharing the resources I used to go from no named Nancy who couldn't get brands to notice her to the visible Business Coach and Lifestyle Influencer who always has brand deals in her inbox. We will go over how to build an audience the right way with a foolproof strategy on how to grow engagement on your blog from day one + how to land brand deals, paid collaborations, sponsored trips and more.I know I've been there, but luckily you can learn from me and avoid years of failed strategies and frustration.

I started blogging back in 2011 and much like you, I had no idea where to start. No one in my social circle was blogging and all I had to compare my work to were the big named bloggers at the time. No one was selling courses and learning how to build an audience wasn't easy because the information wasn't made readily available. After seeing just how profitable a properly constructed website could be I set out to learn everything I possibly could about turning my passion project into profit.

I created The Essential Guide To Blogging because everyone deserves to make a living doing what they love. As my following grew I was able to cut down my hours at my 9-5, little by little. The more I made online the less time I had to work an unfulfilling job that didn't serve me.

The Essential Guide to Blogging is a course that will change the way you look at blogging forever. Blogging has come a long way from being a hobby, it's one of the most lucrative work from home job out there.

""What if they don't get results after buying what I have to offer?""

""I can't spend the time and money planning another failed launch!""

I successfully help entrepreneurs just like you get visible and make bank from their launches when they follow the exact strategy I'm about to share with you in this intensive.

I know what it feels like to spend days, weeks and months planning and posting then hearing crickets after the offer has been made. Within the first hour you'll learn the #1 mistake entrepreneurs make when it comes to launching and how you can prevent or stop doing this yourself.

Using this step by step process you'll discover how I've been able to generate consistent income by offering anywhere from a $7 to $10,000+ offer and how you can too!

According to Copyblogger “copywriting is the art and science of strategically delivering words (whether written or spoken) that get people to take some form of action.” When you can write your words in a way that make people feel something, they remember you. When your audience remembers, you and your business stand out in the sea of other people who are trying to do what you're doing.


Copywriting is the heart and soul of your business. It doesn't matter how great your product is if you can't write a great product description. It doesn't matter how great your services are if you can't convey to your audience why this is for them. It doesn't matter how amazing your blog post is if you can't highlight the key takeaways from that post to make them want to visit your website to read it.



Wake up your audience by working on your word game

Increase your sales by saying the right thing. 





Good copy can:

-Boost your sales

-Help you become a strong voice in your industry

-Get your readers to take action

Learn how inside this intensive workshop!










The Three Magic W's 









Understanding what you're selling, who you're selling it to, and why, is the first step to identifying HOW to market to your aligned ideal client (AIC), meaning they understand this offer is for them and can't live without it.

Learn how to turn the answers you find from those three magic W's into a WHOLEEEE lotta cashflow.


Feeling like you need to revisit who your ideal client is? No problem. Inside this workshop, you'll get a series of quick exercises designed to help you find clarity around who you're serving and how to serve them at the beginning, middle, and end of their journey. Your AIC's, much like you, goes through various stages and their journey is a big part of what we'll be focusing on in this section so you can find the right words to attract them.











The Three Magic Offers + Pricing Structures 









Now that you have clearly identified the different stages of your AIC's journey, it's time to create offers that align with the stage they are in. This is the magic behind the saying, never leave money on the table. It's a lot easier to reach a six-figure year (without the overwhelm) when your offers are designed to naturally progress with the various stages your AIC goes through.


It's also a lot easier to ""charge your worth"" when your offers are worthy of investing in. Discover the magic of a profitable product suite when you learn how to create offers that flow effortlessly from one to the next with my unique FLOW Formula.











The (only) Three Magic Marketing Strategies 









This final part of the BFMO workshop is creating a marketing plan to help you implement so you can see an immediate return on your investment. This workshop was designed to help you LEARN AND EARN. You will receive a FULL Launch Strategy to help you get started putting your magic offers into the world starting Monday, November 23rd all the way through Monday, November 30th. This launch strategy is so simple my ancestors could do it. Why? We're only focusing on mastering 3 things. 1. Copy for Instagram & Facebook 2. Instagram Story Selling
